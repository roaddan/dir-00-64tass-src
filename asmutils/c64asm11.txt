I have uploaded my utility to ftp.funet.fi. It is not a CBM file.
This is a assembler package for 6502 processors, focused mainly on C64.
But the utilities itself run on PC with DOS. I don't know if you accept this
kind of software, but anyway I give it a try.

Here is it's short description.

I have uploaded:
